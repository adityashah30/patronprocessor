Date: 02/11/2013

Objective: 
This program processes the ASCII report generated by the LIBSYS software and processes the file line by line to extract the records of the patrons.

Usage:
Navigate to the folder where the program is stored from the terminal
then choose either of the approaches to run the program script
1)run via python: python patronprocessor.py
					OR
2)run directly via bash shell: a)chmod a+x patronprocessor.py
							   b)./patronprocessor.py

Explanation: 
1) When prompted to enter the path of the patron file, give the full path of the ASCII report generated by LIBSYS regarding patron information. If the program is in the same directory as the patron file, just the file name will suffice but enter the full path of the file otherwise.
2) When prompted to enter the path of the file where the records are to be stored, give the full path of the file where you wish to save all the records after processing. Note that, if the file doesn't exist then the program will create the new file and if the file already exists, it will be overwritten. Same as the file before, if you wish to specify the file in the same directory as the program, just enter the name of the file else enter the entire path.
3) When prompted to enter the path of the final csv file, give the full path of the file where you wish to save the final csv file to be imported directly into koha. Note that, if the file doesn't exist then the program will create the file and if it exists already, it will be overwritten. Same as the file before, if you wish to specify the file in the same directory as the program, just enter the name of the file else enter the entire path.
